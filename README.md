Multi Vulnerability Web Scanner is a smart, fast and reliable tool built to scan websites for security vulnerabilities. It helps developers and website owners spot weaknesses before hackers do making web security simpler and more accessible.

🚀 What It Can Do

SQL Injection Detection (SQLi)
Finds spots where unsafe database queries could let attackers sneak in or steal data.

Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Checks
Spots if a website allows harmful scripts that could affect users.

Command Injection Detection
Detects places where attackers could run commands remotely.

Port and Header Analysis
Scans open ports and HTTP headers to find misconfigurations or risks.


Detailed Reports
Clean, organized results with vulnerability type, risk level and recommended fixes.

Custom Scans
Focus on what matters most by choosing which vulnerabilities to check.

Continuous & Historical Tracking
Scan multiple pages or entire sites and keep records to track security improvements over time.

Risk Level Indicators
Issues are color coded by severity: Critical, Medium or Low risk.

⚙️ How It Works

1. Enter a Website URL – Tell the scanner where to look.

2. Automated Testing – Smart tests for common vulnerabilities run automatically.

3. View Reports – Findings are presented in a detailed easy to read format so you can act fast.
