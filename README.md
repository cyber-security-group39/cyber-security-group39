🛡️ Multi Vulnerability Web Scanner

Multi Vulnerability Web Scanner is a smart, fast and reliable tool built to scan websites for security vulnerabilities. It helps developers and website owners spot weaknesses before hackers do making web security simpler and more accessible.

🚀 What It Can Do

SQL Injection Detection (SQLi)
Finds spots where unsafe database queries could let attackers sneak in or steal data.

Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Checks
Spots if a website allows harmful scripts that could affect users.

Command Injection Detection
Detects places where attackers could run commands remotely.

Port and Header Analysis
Scans open ports and HTTP headers to find misconfigurations or risks.

AI Assistant
Your personal guide inside the scanner. Ask it things like “How do I fix this vulnerability?” and it gives clear step by step advice.

Detailed Reports
Clean, organized results with vulnerability type, risk level and recommended fixes.

Custom Scans
Focus on what matters most by choosing which vulnerabilities to check.

Continuous & Historical Tracking
Scan multiple pages or entire sites and keep records to track security improvements over time.

Risk Level Indicators
Issues are color coded by severity: Critical, Medium or Low risk.

⚙️ How It Works

1. Enter a Website URL – Tell the scanner where to look.

2. Automated Testing – Smart tests for common vulnerabilities run automatically.

3. AI Guidance – If vulnerabilities are found the AI Assistant explains what they mean and how to fix them.

4. View Reports – Findings are presented in a detailed easy to read format so you can act fast.

🏗️ Installation & Usage

Instructions for installing and running the scanner will be added once the project is ready for release.
